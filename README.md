KNN Car Evaluation Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for car evaluation using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python.

Dataset
The car evaluation dataset used in this project is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of various features describing different aspects of a car, such as buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, number of passengers, etc. The target variable is the car's class, which represents the final decision on its acceptability.

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
